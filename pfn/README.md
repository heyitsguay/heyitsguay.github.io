### aka Project Florence Nightingeel

Hey Eli! ❤️

I'm not done with this project, but I'm ready to explain to you what it is and to show you where I am with it. The project is a picture, but I want to explain how I got here before I show you!

#### The deal

---

When you told me I could have your space voyage poster and I offered to get you a replacement, I started wondering if I could make you a replacement instead. The trick would be making something that fits your aesthetic. I wanted to find a way to do that in my bag of image-making tricks. 

I imagined an abstract black and white photograph, focusing on the interplay of light and shadow across some geometric subject. I can't make anything so sophisticated, but I decided to try and capture some portion of the idea of an abstract geometric black and white image. Though of course, I couldn't resist adding a touch of color :)

What I have to show you now is just a concept, not a finished product. It's the output of many iterations (287 so far!) on a python function I have written in a jupyter notebook. If you think this idea can be made into something you would want hanging on your wall, I would like to work with you to do that. There is a huge range of alterations that can be explored with a few parameter tweaks. If you don't think it fits with your style, that is ok too and I hope you will tell me! I want anything I give you to be a gift, not an obligation.

So without further ado
