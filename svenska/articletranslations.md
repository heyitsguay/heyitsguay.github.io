#### Knowing several languages is good for finding jobs

Employers would like to hire people who speak several languages. To speak several languages is a competency that is becoming mre and more important in the job market. P3 News tell this [story].

Statistics show that Sweden is the country in the EU where the most people speak a foreign language. That is, another language than Swedish. Many young Swedes want to learn new languages. And it can help for finding a good job.

The company Ikea for example is a popular workplace among young people. If one seeks a job in Ikea, it is a plus to speak another language. It doesn't matter which language, all are good. This says Andreas Castor from Ikea Sweden to P3 News.

- From our side of course, language skills are a very good merit to have when one seeks a job and when one works with us. And therefore it is also not crucial for us which language, he says.

Ikea has, among other things, started a customer center in Arabic in Sweden.
