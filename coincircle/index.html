                    Place a quarter on a table, and surround
                    it with six other quarters
                </p>

                <p>
                    The quarters are almost, but not entirely, all in
                    contact - the inner quarter touching all the outer
                    ones, and each outer quarter touching both of its
                    neighbors.

                    Why are there gaps? Is it
                    due to imperfections in the coins, or would seven
                    perfect circles arranged in this way have gaps as
                    well? What happens if the size of the outer
                    coins is different from the size of the inner
                    coins?

                <h2>Deriving an answer</h2>

                <p>
                    We can answer these questions with geometry!
                    We'll assume the inner coin has a radius \(a\),
                    and the outer coins all have radius \(b\).
                </p>

                <canvas class="canvas" width="338px" height="338px"
                        id="derivation-canvas"></canvas>

                <p>
                    The centers of an inner coin and two touching
                    outer coins form a triangle with inner angle
                    \(\theta\). We can write an equation relating
                    \(\theta\), \(a\), and \(b\) using the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_cosines"
                    target="_blank">law of cosines</a>, which states
                    that for any triangle:
                </p>

                <canvas class="canvas" width="338px" height="338px"
                        id="loc1-canvas"></canvas>

                <p>
                    the sides \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are related by
                    the equation $$z^2 = x^2 + y^2
                    -2xy\cos(\theta).\quad[1]$$
                    We can set up our coin triangle like this, so that
                    \(x=a+b,\) \(y=a+b,\) and \(z=2b\).
                </p>

                <canvas class="canvas" width="338px" height="338px"
                        id="loc2-canvas"></canvas>

                <p>
                    Substituting those values for \(x,\) \(y,\)
                    and \(z\) into equation [1] gives us
                    $$(2b)^2 = 2(a+b)^2 - 2(a+b)^2\cos(\theta),$$

                    which can be simplified to

                    $$2b^2 = (a+b)^2(1-\cos(\theta)).\quad[2]$$
                </p>

                <p>
                    Given values for any two of the unknown
                    quantities, we can easily solve for the third.
                    We can use that knowledge to answer this question:
                    <i>If we know the size of our inner coin, and we
                        want to make a perfect ring around it with
                        \(n\) outer coins, how large must each outer
                        coin be?</i>
                </p>

                <p>
                    If all of
                    the outer coins surround the inner coin and form a
                    perfect ring, each successive two outer coins
                    must form the same triangle with the inner coin
                    that was demonstrated in the last picture.
                    If we have \(n\) outer coins, we also have \(n\) of
                    these triangles, each with an angle \(\theta\) at
                    the center of the inner coin. All of these angles
                    must add up to 360°, so

                    $$\theta = 360^{\circ} / n.$$

                    If we specify the fixed value \(a_0\) for the
                    inner coin's radius, we can modify equation [2]
                    to create a certain function of the outer coin
                    radius \(b\):

                    $$f(b)=2b^2-(a_0+b)^2\left(1-\cos\left(\frac{360^{\circ}}{n}\right)\right)$$

                    Why make up this function? If we can find a
                    \(b_0\) such that \(f(b_0)=0\), then the values
                    \(a=a_0\), \(b=b_0\), \(\theta=360^{\circ}/n\)
                    solve equation [2]! In other words, we can use
                    \(n\) outer coins of radius \(b_0\) to form a
                    perfect ring around an inner coin of radius
                    \(a_0\). And it's easy to numerically find the
                    zeroes of functions like \(f\).
                </p>

                <h3>Example: Seven quarters</h3>

                <p>
                    Let's use this to answer our first question:
                    Should six quarters make a perfect ring around
                    another quarter?

                    Units don't matter, so let's assume our inner
                    quarter has radius \(1.\) Using \(a_0=1\) and
                    \(n=6,\) we can verify that \(f(1)=0,\) which
                    means that \(b_0=1.\) In other words, to make a
                    perfect ring around a quarter with six coins,
                    each outer coin must be the same size as the inner
                    quarter, i.e. another quarter! <b>With perfect
                    quarters, there would be no gaps.</b>
