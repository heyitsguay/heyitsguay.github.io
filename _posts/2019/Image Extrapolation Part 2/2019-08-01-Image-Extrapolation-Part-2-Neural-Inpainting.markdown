To figure out where to begin, I need to do a literature search on the neural architectures people are using right now for image extrapolation and inpainting. I'll start looking at [Papers With Code](paperswithcode.com), since papers with reproducible examples are much easier to adapt to new data. 

## Papers With Code Summary

Links to relevant papers and codebases from Papers With Code for image extrapolation and inpainting.
