## About me

My name is **Matt Guay**! I live in the DC area, and I work at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on machine learning tools for computer vision problems in microscopy with [these folks](www.nibib.nih.gov/labs-at-nibib/laboratory-cellular-imaging-and-macromolecular-biophysics-lcimb/cellular-and-supramolecular-structure-and-function). I'm interested in **machine learning**, **generative art**, and **VR/AR design**.
