My name is Matt Guay, and I am a [postdoctoral research fellow at the NIH](https://www.nibib.nih.gov/about-nibib/staff/matthew-guay), where I use deep neural networks to solve computer vision problems in microscopy image analysis. When I am not working, I enjoy hiking, biking, climbing, camping, cooking, and creative coding.
